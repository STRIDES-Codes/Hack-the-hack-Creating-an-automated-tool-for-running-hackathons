# Hack-the-hack-Creating-an-automated-tool-for-running-hackathons

The aim of this project is to automate the work needed for organizing and setting up a hackathon. The event organizer will need to provide a CSV file with the following information:
- Name, email, and github username of participants
- Header of CSV file must include "name", "email", and "github" (any order, case does not matter)
- *Optional*: project each particpant is working on (header must also include "project" somewhere)
  - If multiple people are working on one project, the project name *must* be spelled the same for all individuals or they will be added to different repositories
  - If some individuals are not assigned a project, they will be placed into existing teams with the fewest members

Refer to the [example file](https://github.com/STRIDES-Codes/Hack-the-hack-Creating-an-automated-tool-for-running-hackathons/blob/main/example.csv) or the [raw example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STRIDES-Codes/Hack-the-hack-Creating-an-automated-tool-for-running-hackathons/main/example.csv).
